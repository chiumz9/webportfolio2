Hi, my name is Chiu, and this is my story. &nbsp;
Some years ago, I was an Aircraft Maintenance Technician. I had developed an interest in technology over the period however was hesitant to pursue it. After some time contemplating and convincing myself, I decided to make a transition. I went on to become a Cybersecurity Analyst for the National Guard. During this time, I attended a two-week python fundamentals class and immediately found a passion for programming. So like any other normal human being, I committed to another transition. Ultimately, I went on to attend and graduated from the General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive program. 
Every day, I look forward to honing my craft and challenging myself to become a better developer.
Thank you for stopping by!

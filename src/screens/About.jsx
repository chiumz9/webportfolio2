        My choice to become a full-stack developer is really my love for both front & back end. I love
        the visual aspect and creativity that goes into front-end development. Being able to see your work
        progress visually and how other people's work inspires your own. On the other hand, I also love the
        back-end just as much; logistics, analytical, and methodical process of it all. Aggregating and collecting
        data then managing and maintaining it in a way so the front-end can function. Back-end is the backbone
        of any application.

        My passion for programming probably originates from my personality. My eagerness
        to learn has made me venture into completely different but interesting fields. Before I began
        developing applications, I was working as a Cybersecurity Analyst and before that, an Aircraft
        Maintenance Technician. From repairing & trouble-shooting aircraft components in maintenance or
        analyzing millions of traffic packets as an analyst. I've learned to work in many different situations.
        Mostly in a fast-paced, high-stressed, and team-oriented environment. Life as an Analyst and
        Technician have molded me to become more; Resilient, Adaptable, Collaborative, Analytical, and
        Resourceful. I may have not taken the most traditional route but I believe these experiences have definitely
        made me into a better developer that I am today and I wouldn't have it any other way.

        My passion for programming originates from my curiosity and that 
        has made me venture off into completely different fields. Before I began
        developing applications, I was working as a Cybersecurity Analyst and before that, an Aircraft
        Maintenance Technician. From repairing & trouble-shooting aircraft components in maintenance or
        analyzing millions of traffic packets as an analyst. I've learned to work in many different situations.
        Mostly in a fast-paced, high-stressed, and team-oriented environment. Life as an Analyst and
        Technician have molded me to become; resilient, adaptable, collaborative, analytical, and
        resourceful. I may have not taken the most traditional route but I believe these experiences have definitely
        made me into a better developer that I am today.

        My pursuit to become a full-stack developer is really my love for both front & back end. I love
        the visual aspect and creativity that goes into front-end development. Being able to see your work
        progress visually and how other people's work inspires your own. On the other hand, I also love the
        back-end just as much dealing with the logistics, analytical, and methodical process of it all. Aggregating and collecting
        data then managing and maintaining it in a way so the front-end can function. Back-end is the backbone
        of any application.

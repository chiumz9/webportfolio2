Hi, 
&nbsp 
My name is Chiu, and this is a little about me.

My name is Chiu, and this is a little about me. 
Some years ago, I was an Aircraft Maintenance Technician. I had developed an interest in technology over the years however was always hesitant to pursue it. After some time of contemplating, I convinced myself to make the transition. I went on to become a Cybersecurity Analyst for the National Guard. During this time, I attended a two-week python fundamentals course and immediately found a passion for programming. So again, after some more time spent in contemplation, like any other normal human being, I committed to another transition. I went on to attend and graduated from the General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive program. Now I look forward to challenging myself every day and honing my skills to become a better developer than I was yesterday.
&nbsp 
Thank you for stopping by!
